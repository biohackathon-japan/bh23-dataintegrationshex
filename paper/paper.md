# Background

In this report, we describe the activities that we have been carrying on during the Biohackathon 2023, held in Shodoshima, Japan. The main goal of the project has been to identify approaches and issues that can be used to integrate large RDF datasets creating  subsets described by Shape Expressions.


# Outcomes


# Future work



## Acknowledgements

We would like to thank the fellow participants at BioHackathon 2023 for their collaboration and constructive advice, which greatly influenced our project. We are grateful to the organizers for providing this platform and the developers of open source language models. Special thanks to our mentors, advisors, and colleagues for their guidance and support. Without their contributions, our project in linked data standardization with LLMs in bioinformatics would not have been possible.
